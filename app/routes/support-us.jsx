              videotape, film and audiotape. These materials, many vulnerable to
              complete deterioration, must be preserved and digitized so that

            <h2>NEH Challenge</h2>

            <p>
              In 2018, GBH received a $750,000 challenge grant from the National
              Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to preserve and digitize the
              most at-risk items in the GBH archival collection, specifically
              83,000 media resources. This effort will preserve the archive we
              have built and ensure that future media assets are properly
              preserved as they are created. The grant calls for a 4:1 match, or
              $3 million in matching dollars over the next four years.
