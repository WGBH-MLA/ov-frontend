Daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, the series traces her from beautiful princess overlooked during the brief reigns of her brother Edward and sister Mary, through her banishment to the Tower. Ascending to the throne, she started as an astute ruler who moved at ease in the masculine world of monarchs and diplomacy. Elizabeth never married and referred to herself as the Virgin Queen, but the prospect of marriage was used as leverage with political friends and foes alike. The first episode of the classic BAFTA and Emmy award-winning series.

      "desc": "Broadcast: Nov. 5-Dec. 3, 1972. Generally considered to be the first of the French naturalistic novels and one of Balzac's most mature works, \"Cousin Bette\" is the story of the revenge of a woman from the family she feels has betrayed her. The author makes clear that the form her vengeance takes is possible only because of the corrupt state of Parisian society in the 1830's, as the middle class were just taking over the trappings of power without the experience to control it. The Hulots, who rose to fortune under Napoleon, hold an important position in the Parisian society of Louis-Philippe. At the head of the clan is the general, who shortly after the opening of the story become a Marshal of France. A bachelor, he is devoted to the family of his brother Hector, a baron and the head of a department in the War Office. A handsome man in his late fifties, Hector has a disastrous weakness for women. His wife is Adeline (nee. Fischer), one of nature's martyrs. Their son Victorin has married Celestine Crevel, and it is hoped that their daughter Hortense will marry a prosperous lawyer. Johann Fischer, Adeline's elderly uncle, is also devoted to the Hulots and is far too generous to his nephew by marriage. The last member of the family is Bette Fischer, Adeline's cousin and Johann's niece, and always called Cousin Bette. She earns a living by doing gold embroidery work, and is described by Balzac as a \"true peasant.\" Like the rest of the family, her origins are in Lorraine. Bette has always resented the way in which she has been treated by the family, who have left her to support herself, and salve their consciences about their \"country cousin\" by inviting her to dine once a week. When Hortense engineers a meeting with Bette's artist protege, Steinbock, and then becomes engaged to him, all without telling her cousin anything, the spinster's fury knows no bounds. She sees in this the final insult from the Hulots and swears to destroy them. She enlists the help of Hector's new mistress, Valerie Marneffe, and together they set out to fulfill their separate ambitions. Valerie wants to make as much money as possible, as quickly as possible; Bette wants revenge. Source: WGBH. archived promotional material.",

      "desc": "Broadcast: Dec. 2-23, 1973. In the Bellona Club on Armistice Day 1922, General Fentiman snoozes peacefully away in his armchair, buried beneath his newspaper. Only someone discovers he isn't snoozing--he's actually dead and has been so for some nine hours. What looks at first like a routine death turns into a murder mystery and a whole series of 'unpleasantnesses', all requiring the considerable talents of Lord Peter Wimsey to untangle.

Before long there are six suspects -- all fellow artists who have recently quarreled with Campbell. Five are obviously red herrings, only one has an alibi. Slowly Wimsey works through the list. A tiny detail -- a tube of flake white missing from the scene of the crime; an identical tube in one of the studios worries him. In an elaborate reconstruction, he shows just how the murder was committed and the killer confesses.",

On his return to his native Cornwall, Ross finds his father dead, leaving him the heir to a run-down estate and house, Nampara. His main sources of revenue, two copper mines, have been neglected and the house run by a drunken common law wife. His intended wife has become engaged to his cousin, Francis, because she thought Poldark perished in the war. His Uncle Charles had agreed to sell the mines to a smooth character named Warleggen. How the feisty Poldark handles these and other troubles is the focus of these two series.",

The story of a man who all Rome thought was a fool, the laughing-stock of its ruling family. Claudius stuttered so badly that his grandmother, Livia, casually suggested severing his head from his body as the only sure cure. He was also afflicted with a limp and incessant twitch. Livia was guilty of a trail of murders and deceptions. Claudius, placed on the throne after the assassination of Caligula, managed to restore some measure of nobility to the world's most powerful nation. Claudius began a just and sensible rule, his efforts directed toward the dream of restoring the cherished Republic but the power-mad around him thwarted his intentions.

When physician John Bold not only falls in love with his daughter Eleanor, but declares Septimus is cheating a charitable foundation for which he is warder, the story takes a comically dramatic turn. Other events which propel this narrative of city life include the appointment of a new bishop, whose wife and chaplain have many schemes of their own.",

The five years preceding England's granting independence to India in 1947 have been called the \"final years of the forced marriage between the two countries, followed by the agonies of divorce.\" It's in that milieu that British and Indian men and women are embroiled in \"The Jewel in the Crown,\" a 14-part series on Mobil Masterpiece Theatre. The story opens in 1942 when turmoil was at its peak in India, the Japanese army poised for invasion and Gandhi rallying his followers in the struggle against British imperialism. A young London-educated Indian, Hari Kumar (Art Malik), suspected of being a subversive by the local British police superintendent, Ronald Merrick (Pigott-Smith), strikes up a romance with a shy young English girl, Daphne Manners (Susan Wooldridge). Their star-crossed affair and Merrick’s persistent hatred for Kumar affect other characters through most of the story. Among these are Barbie Batchelor (Dame Peggy Ashcroft), a slightly dotty retired missionary; Lady Manners (Rachel Kempson), Daphne’s aunt; Mildred Layton (Judy Parfitt), a promiscuous English lady, and her two daughters, Sarah and Susan. Others include Count Bronowsky, chief minister to an Indian leader, the Nawab; Teddie Bingham, the young soldier who marries Susan Layton; and Guy Perron, a young British Intelligence officer. The series was adapted from Paul Scott’s four novels known collectively as \"The Raj Quartet\". Source: WGBH Press Kit, barcode 379367.

He won fame with elegant, mischievous comedies through the 1920s. During the late 1940s and into the 1950s, the works of Noel Coward fell into temporary disfavor. The mischievous stage comedies that made him a favorite were considered old hat, too glib for a grim post-World War II world. Unwilling to stop writing, Coward began to concentrate on short stories, something he had begun as a way to relax between his plays and songs during the 1930s. Viewers get a close-up look at Coward's genius when adaptations of five stories air under the umbrella title \"Star Quality.\" The stories, with impressive casts, reflect a sensitivity and insight into the human spirit not always present in his brilliant but often brittle stage comedies. A BBC Television production in association with Quintet Films and Arts and Entertainment. See Dial magazine/program guide, March 1987, for related story.
